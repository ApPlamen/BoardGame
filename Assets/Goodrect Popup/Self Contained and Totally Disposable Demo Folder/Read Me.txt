Thank you for buying my asset!

If you didn't however, I still love you (not).

This folder contains various demo scenes, displaying different types of multichoice and prompt popups.
Once you familiarize yourself with the workings of this asset, feel free to
delete this folder altogether.

Also, there is a downloadable version of the same documentation here:

All the disposable content is in this folder.
Because I'm nice like that.
